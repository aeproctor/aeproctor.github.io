                This is a 31-page user manual on the program Microsoft Word 365 with the intended audience of law students. I wrote this manual for my Professional Writing and Technical Communication I course in Fall 2019. Through creating this manual I learned how to write modular, task-oriented documentation as well as how to implement basic elements of design.

                I wrote this 24-page grant proposal for my Introduction to Professional Writing course in Fall 2019. It is a comprehensive proposal for the creation of a youth garden at my former high school. The main idea behind this proposal was to find an interactive way to promote student engagement with nature and environmental studies. For this project I not only learned how to write a grant proposal, but also conducted research into the creation of youth gardens and the benefits of gardening for teenagers.

                This is an essay from my studies in Victorian literature titled, "The Punishment of Marjorie Lindon in <em>The Beetle</em>." I wrote it for a course called Victorian Imagination in Fall 2019. Within the essay, I analyzed the anti-feminist themes of Richard Marsh's 1897 horror novel <em>The Beetle</em>. Although the novel is about a shapeshifting monster, the real horror is Marsh's treatment of minorities and gender identities. It is one of several essays I wrote on feminism and Victorian literature, a subject I remain passionate about.

                This is an essay titled "Landscape and Violence in Irish Poetry." I wrote this essay in Spring 2019 for my Literature of Ireland course. The essay examines how the poets Eavan Boland and Seamus Heaney look to Ireland's landscape to confront the country's violent history and reconcile its status as a post-colonial nation.
