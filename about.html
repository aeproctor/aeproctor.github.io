                My name is Anna Proctor and I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. I am currently majoring in English with a specialization in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communications</a>. In addition, I am minoring in Linguistics. As a soon-to-be college graduate, I am looking forward to a career in technical writing!

                Although I initially chose to study English because of my love of literary analysis—specifically focusing on Irish and Victorian literature—I have since gained an interest in the world of technical writing. In my classes so far, I have learned many of the fundamentals of technical writing and have begun to create my own body of work. I have written a 24-page grant proposal as well as a 33-page Microsoft Word user manual which are both included in my portfolio. Through creating these documents, I have learned elements of graphic design and how to successfully relay technical information to different audiences. Currently, I am learning how to create websites with HTML and CSS. I am also learning to use technical writing related software such as Madcap Flare and Adobe Indesign. While a field like technical writing appeals to my desire for organization and structure, it also allows me to explore my creative side which drew me towards the English major in the first place.
