    <h1>Client Site Ideas</h1>
    <p><em>(in order of preference)</em></p>
    
        <h2>Marshfield Historical Society website</h2>
            <p>The Marshfield Historical society is a small organization in my hometown. They use their existing website to promote local events and provide information about historical properties. They are also connected with a very small museum and use the site to show some digital samples of the museum's collections, like old documents and maps. Their website, however, is old and has problems such as pictures not appearing properly and links that no longer work. Updating their website could help them promote the work they do and increase interest in their events. I also know a member of the society who I could reach out to about improvements they may like to see in their website.</p>

        <h2>Bookstore website</h2>
            <p>This website would be a for a small independent bookstore. I have noticed that a lot of small bookstores either don't have websites or the ones they do have are outdated and difficult to navigate. The pages I would make may include one about the store, their actual stock, book recommendations, and events. I would design this site around a nonexisting store.</p>

        <h2>Doo Wop Deville website</h2>
            <p>Doo Wop Deville is my aunt and uncle's band that plays music from the 50s as well as some original songs. They regularly perform at restaurants in Massachusetts. They already have a good website, but I thought that designing a website for a band might be an interesting project anyways. I could include pages like "About the Members," a link to their music, how to contact them, their upcoming performances, and the like.</p>
