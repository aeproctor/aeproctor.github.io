                My name is Anna Proctor and I am a recent graduate of the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. I have a degree in English with a specialization in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/" target="_blank">Professional Writing and Technical Communications</a>. In addition, I am minoring in Linguistics. Now that I have graduated, I am looking forward to beginning my career in technical writing!

                Although I initially chose to study English because of my love of literary analysis—specifically focusing on Irish and Victorian literature—I have since gained an interest in technical writing. In my classes, I have learned the fundamentals of technical writing and have created my own body of work. I have written a 24-page grant proposal as well as a 33-page Microsoft Word user manual which are both included in my portfolio. Through creating these documents, I have learned elements of graphic design and how to successfully relay technical information to different audiences. My more recent projects include a guide to creating accessible web content using Microsoft Word and Madcap Flare. The website itself was created using Madcap Flare for both web and PDF outputs. Another recent project is a portfolio of design work using Adobe InDesign. My designs consist of flyers, a book chapter, and a magazine layout. While a field like technical writing appeals to my desire for organization and structure, it also allows me to explore my creative side which drew me towards the English major in the first place.
